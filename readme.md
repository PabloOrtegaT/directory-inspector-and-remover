# Directory inspector & remover

_This is a directory inspector and also works as a directory remover_

## How-to use

For navigation, you just need to type 

node directory.js "directory-to-navigate"

it accepts absolute and relative paths and only takes into account the first parameter you put right next to directory.js.

For deletion, you need to type 

node directory.js delete "directory-to-delete"

it only accepts relative paths, so you can only delete files within the directory of the project.
